# TuckerNetworking

**TuckerNetworking** is a lightweight and modern Swift networking library designed from the ground up with Swift Concurrency in mind. It provides a simple and expressive API for making HTTP requests using `async/await`, making it ideal for modern Swift projects targeting iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
TuckerNetworking was designed to be reused in your whole project, eliminating non-standard API calls, and hard-to-debug code.

> Built with Swift 6.0 compatibility and best practices — ideal for apps written with modern concurrency at their core.
